GenBank file parser and database
================================

Description of project
----------------------
This tier of the project aims to parse a GenBank file and store some
relevant information in an SQL database.

Setup
-----
Some steps must be taken prior to use of the parser.
Please see the 'Dependencies' section below for required imports.
As well as these, before using the parser.py file, the split_file.py script must
be run. This takes the raw GenBank file and splits it at the '//' entry separator.
Thus, a separate file for each gene locus is generated.
Ensure that these files are contained in a directory with nothing else in it.
Once this step has been completed, set the 'indir' variable in the parser.py script
as the path to this directory containing your split files.

Dependencies
------------
split_file.py:
    import re

parser.py:
    import re
    import os
    import pandas as pd
